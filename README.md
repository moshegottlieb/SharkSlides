# SharkSlides

SharkSlides is a simple yet useful slideshow viewer.  
It can play any just about any quicktime available image or video format.  
View slideshows using Photos as the source featuring shuffle (which is a feature we missed most in Photos) and video playback.  
Choose from either Photos or select files or folders from your computer.  

__Shark slides was built using an old version of swift and does not currently compile in modern Xcode__
